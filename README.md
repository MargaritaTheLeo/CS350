Embedded Systems

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
The idea of this project was to program a basic thermostat using a launchpad provided by Texas Instruments. The red LED light lights up if the heat is “on”, meaning that the detected room temperature is rising. We can manipulate the temperature with the help of two buttons. One button for decreasing and another one for increasing the temperature. The UART2 driver is used to simulate sending data to server. The timer used for this project updates the system every 5 seconds.
 
 •	What did you do particularly well?
  
Each milestone in this course prepared me for completing this project. By completing each milestone in a timely manner, I was able to learn the necessary skills and concepts. I think I managed to create a modular code, and I was able to reuse some of the code from the milestones.

•	Where could you improve?

While working on this project, I had some issues. Primarily, I was having a hard time writing code for certain drivers because the resources provided by the university described older versions of the drivers. I think that in the future I will need to learn to search for the needed information in a more efficient way. 

•	What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

After having finished all the milestones and the final project for this course, I feel more comfortable working with embedded systems. I also learnt how to work with a variety of resources, and it boosted my programming skills. 

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Because the code for this project included multiple drivers, modules, and components, I was able to practice writing a clean and modular code. I also learnt how to work with timers, GPIO, UART, I2C, and task schedulers.

•	How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

To make my code maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I did my best to divide the code into logically connected chunks. I also used meaningful names for my variables and function. Finally, I made sure I provided extensive and concise comments so that other developers could understand the logic behind my code.
